# Brain Tumor Detection Project

## Overview
This project is focused on detecting brain tumors using multiple neural network models, including CNN, YOLOv8, and YOLOv9. It aims to provide an efficient and comparative analysis of each model's performance on brain tumor detection.

## Models Used
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**: Basic neural network model trained for brain tumor classification.
- **YOLOv8 and YOLOv9**: Advanced object detection models used to detect tumor regions in MRI images.

## Unique Features
- Comprehensive analysis of CNN, YOLOv8, and YOLOv9.
- Future scope includes implementing a **CNN-YOLO hybrid model** to improve detection accuracy and efficiency.

## Future Scope
The next step is to experiment with a hybrid model combining CNN with YOLOv8/YOLOv9 for enhanced performance and accuracy.

## Dataset
- Utilized the Medical Image Dataset from Kaggle, including MRI scans labeled for tumor presence.

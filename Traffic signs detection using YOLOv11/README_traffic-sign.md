# Traffic signs detection using YOLOv11

## Introduction

Traffic sign detection is an essential task in autonomous driving. By leveraging YOLOv11's capabilities, this project aims to accurately detect various traffic signs from images or video streams, contributing to road safety and navigation assistance.

The scope of the project can also be expanded for blind people by converting the detected signs into audio using Text to Speech APIs.

## Requirements

- Python
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Datasets

- YAML file for fine tuning YOLOv11: [YAML file](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sohamshah03/yamlfile)

- Traffic signs dataset: [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pkdarabi/cardetection)
